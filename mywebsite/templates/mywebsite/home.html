          Uzma manufacturing is a major industry. It is largely based on the conversion of fibre into yarn, yarn into fabric.

There are many variable processes available at the spinning and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the finishing and colouration processes to the production of a wide range of products.The producing sectors build upon a wealth of clothing technology some of which, like the loom, the cotton gin, and the sewing machine heralded industrialization not only of the previous textile manufacturing practices.    <ul>
